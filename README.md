This project is for my own learning about higher order components from a tutorial.

what is a higher order component?
  -react component that adds some additional functionality or behavior to an
  existing component that you have already written or plan to write in the future
  -returns an "enhanced or composed" component
  -these are a great way to extract functionality that is common to multiple components
  within our app
  -helps dry up code
  -commonly used with 3rd party libraries, for example, the "connect" function from
  react-redux
